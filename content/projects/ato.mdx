## TL;DR

ATO is a production-grade, AI-powered Chrome extension that intelligently organizes browser tabs at scale.
It supports real-time and on-demand tab grouping using semantic AI, usage prediction, and access history.
The project is a full end-to-end system (extension, backend, and website), used daily by hundreds of users - **including paying customers** - and built with a scalable AWS-based architecture and a tokenized AI usage model.

ATO (AI Tab Organizer) was born out of a very real problem I had myself: my browser constantly turned into chaos. Dozens - sometimes hundreds - of open tabs across multiple windows, all competing for attention.

Instead of closing tabs and losing context, I wanted a system that could understand what each tab represents and organize everything intelligently - with minimal effort from the user.

That idea grew into ATO, a full-scale product that today has hundreds of users, real usage at scale, and active paying subscribers. 🚀

## What ATO Does

ATO automatically sorts, groups, and manages browser tabs using real AI - turning tab overload into a clean, structured workspace.

### Two ways to use ATO

- **Organize on demand**: One click instantly organizes all open tabs. Perfect for heavy tab users (20-300 tabs).
- **Dynamic auto-organizing**: Every new tab is organized the moment it’s opened - keeping the browser clean at all times.

### Smart AI organization methods

- **By category (semantic grouping)**: Tabs are grouped into meaningful domains like News, Shopping, Finance, Work, Docs, Social, Entertainment, Tools, and more - based on content, not just URLs.
- **By last access**: Recently used tabs stay front and center, while older tabs are grouped away neatly.
- **By frequency (prediction mode)**: Tabs are prioritized based on usage patterns, predicting what the user is most likely to open next.

### Tab management tools

Beyond grouping, ATO offers a full set of productivity tools:

- **Instant search** across all open tabs
- **Smart tab renaming** (great when many tabs share similar titles)
- **Automatic duplicate tab cleanup**
- **Collapse / expand** all tab groups
- **Ungroup** all tabs
- **Intelligent sorting** of tab groups based on the selected method

All actions are designed to be fast, predictable, and low-friction.

## Architecture & Technical Depth

ATO is not just a Chrome extension - it’s a complete system made of three coordinated parts:

- **ATO Client (Chrome Extension)**: Built with **Plasmo**, enabling modern React-based development and smooth extension DX.
- **ATO Server**: Deployed on **AWS Lambda**, using:
  - **Amazon Cognito** for authentication and user management
  - **AWS DynamoDB** for token tracking and usage control
  - A scalable token-based mechanism that enables flexible pricing models
- **ATO Website**: A public marketing and onboarding site ([`atobase.app`](https://www.atobase.app/)), supporting subscriptions and user education.

## AI & Product Design Decisions

A key design requirement for ATO was plug-and-play onboarding.

Users do not need to bring their own API keys or configure anything. The server securely handles all AI requests, abstracts complexity away from the user, and enforces fair usage via a token system.

This approach prioritizes:

- **Security**
- **Ease of use**
- **Predictable costs**
- **A clean user experience**

## Adoption & Real Users

- **Hundreds of downloads**
- **Active daily users**
- **Paying customers** using the product in real workflows

ATO is continuously evolving based on real feedback and usage patterns - not just ideas on paper.

## Tech Stack

- **Client**: Chrome Extension built with Plasmo (React)
- **Server**: AWS Lambda
- **Auth**: Amazon Cognito
- **Database**: DynamoDB
- **AI**: Server-side AI requests (no BYOK required)

The codebase is not open source.
