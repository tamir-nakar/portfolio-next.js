<p><b>ATO – Your AI-Powered Tab Organizer & Smart Tab Manager.</b> ATO automatically sorts, groups, and manages your browser tabs using real AI — keeping your workspace clean and easy to navigate. It already has <b>hundreds of downloads</b> and <b>paying customers</b>.</p>

<p><b>This project is a full system made of 3 working parts</b> that operate together: <b>ATO Client</b> (the Chrome extension), <b>ATO Server</b>, and the <b>ATO website</b> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.atobase.app/">atobase.app</a>).</p>

### Two ways to use ATO

- **Organize on demand**: One click to instantly organize all open tabs — great for heavy tab users (20–300 tabs).
- **Dynamic auto-organizing**: Every new tab is organized the moment it’s opened, so your browsing stays structured all the time.

### Smart AI organization methods

- **By category (semantic grouping)**: Groups tabs into meaningful categories like News, Shopping, Finance, Sports, Entertainment, Tools, Docs, Social, Work, and more.
- **By last access**: Keeps recently used tabs easy to reach while older ones are neatly grouped away.
- **By frequency (prediction mode)**: Prioritizes tabs you’re most likely to use next based on usage patterns.

### Tab management tools

- **Search tabs** instantly across all open tabs
- **Rename tabs** for clarity (especially when titles look the same)
- **Clean duplicate tabs** automatically
- **Ungroup all tabs**
- **Collapse / expand all tab groups**
- **Smart sorting** of tab groups based on your chosen method

### Tech stack / architecture

- **Client (Chrome extension)**: Built with **Plasmo** — a modern framework/tooling layer that streamlines building and shipping browser extensions (React + great DX).
- **Server**: Deployed on **AWS Lambda**, with **Amazon Cognito** for userbase/authentication and **AWS DynamoDB** as the NoSQL database — together enabling a robust token mechanism.
- **AI**: A key requirement for me was **plug-and-play** onboarding — users don’t need to bring their own API key. The extension relies on the server to securely make AI requests.
- **Source**: The codebase is **not open source**.
