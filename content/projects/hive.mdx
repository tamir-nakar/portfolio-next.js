 <p><b>The Hive app was my first step into the world of extensions. I was always thinking that Chrome could do better in terms of bookmark management, and I wanted a way to navigate among my bookmarks quickly, <u>without having to reach for the mouse</u>. I couldn't have imagined back then that this extension would have thousands of downloads and hundreds of active users! ðŸ¤© </b></p>
