 <p><b> Like many others, I too wanted a polished platform to showcase my projects.</b></p>
 <p> My first go at a developer portfolio involved `WordPress` and `Elementor`, with my projects hosted on `Heroku`. It did the job, but over time, I felt it lacked the versatility I craved. While the plugins were handy, they couldn't quite deliver that extra something I was after. </p>
 <p> Recently, I've been delving into `Next.js`, and I've got to say, the mix of `React`'s flexibility as a server-side rendering engine, along with the CMS-like perks of `MDX`, is absolutely  brilliant! Plus, the way it seamlessly integrates with `Vercel`, where both my site and projects are hosted, just adds to the smooth sailing. Managing my content this way feels seamless and efficient. </p>
